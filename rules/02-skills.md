# Min/Maxing

When players create characters, they decide what to emphasize and disregard. 
Characters can fight effectively, handle delicate social situations, 
investigate crimes, and whatever else your game supports. Games should let 
characters be proficient in many areas but not good at everything. However, 
many games make it worthwhile to focus heavily on a few things and almost 
completely disregard everything else. This is called min/maxing.

Characters made this way are bad at many things, and how much this matters 
depends on the game. RPGs unable to penalize you for doing many things poorly 
are easy to exploit through min/maxing. This section explains how many games 
let you get away with this, since we designed L7R mechanics with these issues 
in mind.

RPGs often have many skills without mechanical benefits. These skills might be 
interesting, but taking them shouldn't make your character worse at useful 
things. Proficiency in music, literary talent, an aptitude for juggling, and 
being practiced in meditation are neat skills. But unless they're useful, 
you're forced to choose between something you like and something you can use. 
This leads to min/maxing by rewarding players who focus on a smaller set of 
more useful skills.

To contrast, many other skills are useful occasionally but do nothing most of 
the time. Swimming, climbing, picking locks, or running quickly could save a 
character's life. However, if characters lacking such skills can't complete 
adventures or even die, the GM has the lose-lose deadlock of penalizing the 
players either very severely or not at all. Avoiding such situations makes the 
game more enjoyable, but also encourages players to neglect these skills and 
emphasize broadly useful ones. This facilitates min/maxing by taking away the 
penalty for disregarding such skills.

Unfortunately, even some broadly useful skills aren't worthwhile if already 
possessed by someone in the group. Finding clues at crime scenes, treating 
wounds, bargaining for low prices, and possessing obscure knowledge can all be 
useful. However, if one player reliably succeeds at such skills, it's often 
pointless for another player to take them.

Besides, while these skills help the whole group, they give no special benefit 
to the character actually using them. So striving for the common good penalizes 
you, because other characters benefit from your skills while advancing ones 
which help only themselves. Players shouldn't have to choose between making 
better characters and helping the group, and this leads to min/maxing by again 
reducing the set of optimal skills. Also, when these skills aren't taken at 
all, GMs get into the kind of lose-lose deadlocks discussed above.

Some games create similar deadlocks by allowing min/maxing in the opposite way. 
So far we've covered how the number of worthwhile skills shrinks far below the 
intended number, thus rewarding players who emphasize only the best skills. But 
having too many skills can promote min/maxing as well, even if every skill is 
useful.

Recall that min/maxing happens when GMs can't penalize players for doing many 
things poorly. But if characters can only be good at a fraction of the 
available skills, GMs can't fairly penalize you for being bad at one individual 
skill. While this doesn't decrease the set of useful skills, it does help you 
min/max by reducing the penalty for doing many things poorly.


# How Should Skills Be Used?

Successfully completing L7R adventures is like winning at chess. People win 
chess games by building up small advantages: taking a pawn, making a favorable 
trade, or putting a piece in a good position. None of these things alone 
achieve victory, but collectively they help execute and defend against 
game-winning attacks.

Similarly, while every skill in L7R has a use, there's nothing you can't do 
without. Characters will have a range of things they're not good at, and 
different characters disregard different skills. Not being good at a skill 
shouldn't limit what you can accomplish; you just won't have that particular 
small advantage.

L7R adventures are rarely straightforward, and there should be multiple ways to 
resolve conflicts. Players must place themselves in good standing with NPCs by 
using skills appropriate to each situation. Because these small advantages are 
the basis for whether your plans will succeed or fail, GMs will keep track of 
how you impress and unimpress relevant NPCs.


# Types of Rolls

Actions which either fail or succeed call for rolls with a target number (TN) 
that you must meet or exceed. Except with certain specific secret TN rolls, the 
GM tells you the TN before you roll, which allows you to spend void points on 
rolls you know are difficult.

Open rolls are used for actions with a range of effectiveness instead of 
success or failure. The higher your roll, the better the result. What your roll 
actually means depends on the skill being used and the situation.

When two characters' actions oppose each other, a contested roll occurs. The 
skills being used may differ, but higher skills grant a bonus: you get a free 
raise for every point your character's skill is higher than your opponent's. 
The higher total wins.

No roll uses more than 10 dice. When the number of rolled dice would exceed 10, 
one extra die is instead kept for every rolled dice above 10. For every rolled 
or kept die beyond 10k10, add 1 to to the result of the roll. Also, certain 
conditions create free raises, which add 5 to a roll's total; these are either 
granted by the GM as situational bonuses or automatically created by advantages 
and schools.

If you roll any skill which you have at 0, you don't reroll 10s. If the skill 
is advanced, subtract 10 from your total. If you roll for an action for which 
there is no skill, the GM will tell you which Ring to use, and you'll roll (2 * 
Ring)k(Ring).


# How Should Skills Be Raised?

We designed L7R skills with two ideals. We wanted players to gain small 
advantages by using a variety of skills and to pick a few skills for their 
characters to excel at. In other words, PCs should be decent at many skills and 
very good at a few skills. Thus, our rules revolves around making characters 
both well rounded and specialized.

One problem here is that skills affect rolled dice, which have a diminishing 
marginal return. For example, you have a 66% chance to roll 15 or higher with 
3k3, and rolling 1 extra die to make it 4k3 ups the odds to 90%. This extra 
rolled die helps considerably and costs very little.

Conversely, while 6k3 has an 82% chance of making at least 20, rolling 2 extra 
dice to make it 8k3 only increases your chances to 93%. These two extra rolled 
dice give less help and cost more. If you raise skills to 3 so easily at 
character creation, why should you raise them any further with XPs, since it 
helps so little?

The first part of the answer is that not all skills should be so high. You 
might raise a skill to meet some specific need, such as being polite or 
understanding military tactics. Because you must only satisfy that need, such 
skills have a good enough point. Raising a skill beyond 2 or 3 isn't necessary 
in these cases.

While this kind of stopping point encourages you to invest in a variety of 
skills instead of min/maxing, it can also prevent you from excelling at 
anything. Consider that not only does raising a skill past its good enough 
point cost a lot, it only helps when rolling that one skill. If you were to 
raise fewer skills and use those XPs to raise a Ring, the benefit could be 
greater and apply to more skills.

However, winning a contested roll requires that you do better than your 
opponent, which makes any improvement helpful. Also, remember that on contested 
rolls you get a free raise for every point your character's skill is higher 
than your opponent's. These are the skills which players should specialize in, 
because excelling at them yields the greatest benefits. Thus, skills only used 
for open rolls should be raised to some good enough point, while skills you 
which roll contested should be raised as high as your interest in them.


# Social Skills

Creating rules for social skills is very tricky; if characters need them to 
talk at all, then every player is forced to raise them. While we want you to 
raise a variety of skills, taking away choices eliminates differences between 
PCs. Consequently, these skills must be well defined; characters can be bad, 
good or superb at them, and the significance of each should be clear.

In particular, we feel that choosing what to say (and do) is really for the 
player, not the character. These skills aren't about what characters say, but 
how well they speak. You can tell the GM a summary of what your character says, 
or speak it out yourself word for word. Either way, rolling social skills 
determines how well your character spoke.

But will it help for every PCs to be well-spoken? What if the group has only 
one character with high social skills? Can't that character just be the group 
spokesperson and do all the important talking? If so, why should other 
characters raise these skills?

GMs must keep this issue in mind when designing and running adventures. 
Situations should need more than one character to contribute; social skills 
aside, it's not fun when several people have nothing to do. If accumulating 
small advantages depends on teamwork, groups can't rely on one character for 
social skills or anything else.


# Knowledge Skills

Skills should be useful. But what use are knowledge skills? Giving you 
information? It can't be vital information, or else taking these skills would 
be a requirement. So either these skills give you nonessential facts, or you 
can get access to the information some other way. Neither of these options make 
knowledge skills very useful.

Besides, once someone in the group has these knowledges, it's no longer 
worthwhile for someone else to spend points raising them. Just as we don't want 
to make a skill so useful that players have no choice but to take it, we don't 
want players to find a good skill rendered useless by another player who does 
it better. Remember, this leads to min/maxing.

Granted, these skills could give tidbits of information and still be giving 
small advantages, but we felt this wasn't useful enough. We solve this dilemma 
by making knowledge skills do more than giving information; mainly they're used 
for making arguments. Every adventure will involve PCs offering advice, and 
these skills might be useful anytime that happens.

These skills make contested rolls when two characters are arguing, and you make 
open rolls with them when making an unopposed argument or trying to recall 
information.

# Detailed Skill Rules

## Acting

**Advanced**

**Ring:** Air

The main use of acting is helping your basic skills; you receive one free raise 
on all sincerity, intimidation, and sneaking rolls which are used to blend into 
crowds for every point of acting your character has. However, less scrupulous 
characters can also use it to pretend to be from another social class. In this 
case, roll acting contested against the interrogation of anyone speaking to the 
character using it.


## bragging

**Ring:** Air

Make an open bragging roll whenever you want to convince someone that you're 
very talented or well qualified in some area. This can represent bragging about 
either your skill in general or one of your specific accomplishments. Either 
way, you receive a bonus of twice your character's Recognition plus twice your 
character's Honor.

When you argue with another character about who is better at something, make a 
contested bragging roll. Sum the Honor and Recognition scores of each character 
and give the character with the higher total an additional bonus equal to twice 
the difference. When bragging on behalf of someone else, use your Honor and 
their Recognition. GMs are always encouraged to also assign free raises to 
either side based on the circumstances.


## Commerce

**Advanced**

**Ring:** Water

Most samurai have only the vaguest notion of how money even works; their needs 
are provided for by their daimyo. This skill grants an understanding of how 
money, taxes, and businesses all function and interact. Roll this open for 
information or to make an unopposed argument, and contested if someone argues 
against you.


## culture

**Ring:** Water

Being cultured is very important to the samurai caste. This ranges from knowing 
which arts and fashions are in style to being well versed in literature and 
drama. Make open rolls to discuss or make decisions about anything covered by 
this skill.

This includes buying gifts; rolling this skill allows you to purchase gifts 
specifically tailored to the recipient, which can both impress them as well as 
save you money. Make an open roll when buying a gift and give yourself a number 
of free raises equal to your commerce. You are able to buy an equivalently good 
gift by spending X% less, where X is your roll minus 25 (minimum 0).


## etiquette

**Ring:** Air

Protocol is extremely important in Rokugan, particularly for encounters which 
are formal and/or with people you've just met. In these situations, make an 
open etiquette roll to act suitably genteel. GMs will often use this as the 
basis for the first impression your characters make on an NPC.


## heraldry

**Ring:** Water

When dealing with any House, it pays to know the local politics, especially 
alliances and feuds between its officials. GMs should take the question being 
asked and assign a base TN according to the chart below, with three potential 
modifications to the TN:
* up to +/- 20 based on how familiar the PCs are with the House
* up to -20 if the PCs are able to conduct specific research about a target
* +/- 5 for each point of Recognition below/above normal for the target's 
station

```
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TN | Information Gained                                                      |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 15 | domain size, wealth, neighbors                                          |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 25 | basic history, political and military alliances                         |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 35 | top officials (Ministers, Councilors, Governors), major lineages        |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 45 | major officials (Provincial Ministers, County Magistrates), lineage     |
|    | politics                                                                |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 55 | noteworthy minor officials, sub-branches within lineages, major         |
|    | merchant houses                                                         |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 65 | unremarkable minor officials, relationships between specific extended   |
|    | families                                                                |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 75 | inconspicuous samurai not assigned to any post                          |
+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


## History (Water):

**Advanced**

**Ring:** Water

With over 1,000 years of history, you'll rarely encounter situations in Rokugan 
which haven't happened before. Make an open roll with this skill to cite a 
historical example in an unopposed argument, and roll contested when someone 
argues against you.

This also aids your basic skills; you receive one free raise on all culture, 
law, and strategy rolls for every point of history your character has. You also 
receive these free raises on heraldry rolls, but these free raises on heraldry 
may not raise your total above 25.


## Interrogation

**Advanced**

**Ring:** Air

Roll this contested against the sincerity of an NPC when you wish to detect 
whether they're lying. If you are speaking to them casually rather than 
grilling them, they get 4 free raises. If instead you are clearly interrogating 
them but they are telling a lie which they believe you are incapable of proving 
wrong, they get 2 free raises. GMs are also encouraged to assign situational 
free raises to the interrogator when the other person is scared, feels guilty, 
etc.

This skill is rolled once for each line of questioning. When you ask questions 
that get closer to the truth and continue to force the other side to lie, you 
receive free raises. Conversely, when the liar manages to steer the 
conversation to things which they have ready answers for or don't have to lie 
at all, they receive free raises.

Exceeding the opposing sincerity roll tells you whether the other person is 
lying. Exceeding it by at least 10 tells you whether they're concealing 
information even if they're not lying outright. Exceeding it by at least 20 
lets you perceive their specific motivations whether they're lying or not.


## intimidation

**Ring:** Air


Make an open intimidation roll when you wish to either make overt threats or be 
implicitly menacing. This can represent either direct threat of physical 
violence or more subtle consequences. For example, when interrogating a 
particular NPC, the GM might decide that a roll of 25 will unsettle the them, a 
roll of 40 will make them very concerned, and a roll of 55 will really shake 
them up. GMs should decide these figures in advanced based on the 
circumstances, but without telling players the final numbers. This is an 
exception to the general rule that players get to know their TNs.


## investigation

**Ring:** Water

Finding criminals often requires many skills, from looking for clues to 
identifying forgeries to breaking codes to following tracks of a fleeing 
suspect. Rolls you make with this skill have TNs, but the GM will not reveal 
them; this is an exception to the rule that TNs are known to players.


## law

**Ring:** Water

Rokugani law gives enormous discretion to magistrate, so what you're forbidden 
or permitted do often depends on whether you can convince NPCs that your 
actions are legitimate. Conversely, you may try to compel NPCs to take some 
action by claiming that it's legally mandated. Either way, make open rolls for 
information and unopposed arguments, and make contested rolls when debating law 
with another character.


## Manipulation

**Advanced**

**Ring:** Air

Roll this skill contested against another character's tact when you wish to 
demand an explanation for something that character said. This can involve 
twisting their words to seem insulting, or even make it look like they're 
saying something they didn't intend to. After declaring exactly what you are 
responding to and how your character is reacting, roll this contested against 
the other person's tact. GMs are encouraged to assign free raises to either 
side based on the circumstances. Success varies based on the amount your roll 
exceeded theirs, according to the following table:

```
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Delta | Effect                                                               |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| <10   | They are forced to admit you have a point, but may restate their     |
|       | own.                                                                 |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 10-20 | They must alter their original statement to respond to what you      |
|       | said.                                                                |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 20-30 | They must retract their original argument but may make a different   |
|       | one.                                                                 |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 30-40 | They must retract their statement and concede that you're right.     |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 40-50 | They must apologize to you for what they said or look bad.           |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


## precepts

**Ring:** Water

Samurai live and die by what they believe to be right, and their sense of 
morality is based on a thousand years of writings on ethical living. Use this 
to argue that your position is the most righteous by citing tenants of bushido, 
sayings of Shinsei, etc. Make open rolls when your argument is unopposed and 
contested rolls when someone argues against you. You receive a bonus of twice 
your honor to all precepts rolls.


## sincerity

**Ring:** Air

The most common use of this skill is to lie; in this case it is rolled 
contested against interrogation. However, you also make an open roll when 
making a statement of commitment or convincing argument which depends on an NPC 
believing that you're sincere. You receive a bonus of twice your honor to all 
open sincerity rolls.


## sneaking

**Ring:** Air

Your character might occasionally wish to go somewhere without being remembered 
or perhaps without being seen at all. Make an open roll when your character has 
minor interactions with NPCs but doesn't wish to be remembered; the greater the 
roll the more unremarkable and forgettable the encounter. Roll this contested 
against the investigation of potential observers when trying to remain 
completely hidden. In either case GMs should often grant situational free 
raises to either side.


## strategy

**Ring:** Water

This skill grants an understanding of tactics as well as how to actually 
command forces of troops, police, etc. It also gives a working knowledge of 
bandits, mercenaries, and creatures from the Shadowlands. Finally, it's used 
for games of skill such as shogi or go. Roll this contested when engaged in a 
game or battle or when arguing against someone, and roll open otherwise.


## tact

**Ring:** Air

Sometimes you have to speak unpleasant truths and/or say things which might not 
be well received. Make an open tact roll before saying something which you know 
might offend someone. If you say something which inadvertently irritates an 
NPC, the GM may let you say something to recover and then call for a tact roll 
with a TN based on the emotions of the NPC and how well you improvised. You 
also use tact in contested rolls against the manipulation skill.


## Underworld

**Advanced**

**Ring:** Water

Bandits, smugglers, bloodspeakers, opium dens, gambling houses, and even ninja 
are rife throughout Rokugan. This skill grants understanding of how these 
groups function and how they interact with one another. This skill is rolled 
open for information and unopposed arguments, and rolled contested when someone 
debates you.
