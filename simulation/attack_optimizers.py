class AttackOptimizer(object):
  '''
  Class that helps optimize spending resources on an attack roll
  by calculating the probability of success when spending different
  amounts of VP and other available resources.

  This class should be used to optimize attack rolls when the goal
  is to hit a TN, and there isn't benefit from exceeding the TN.

  The Akodo Bushi School's Feint is a good example of an attack
  where the only purpose is to hit the TN.
