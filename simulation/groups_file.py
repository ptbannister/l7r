# A single YAML file gives the groups and the names of the characters in the group.

    read(path, characterd) -> list of Group
      f (file like object): file like object to access groups.yaml file

    Returns a list of groups of characters.
    The groups are defined in yroups.yaml,
    and the characters are defined in other files
    in the same directory.

    The groups.yaml format is like this:

      characters:
      - akodo
      - doji
    west:
      test: true

      - bayushi
      - hida
