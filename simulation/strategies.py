class Strategy(ABC):
  '''
  Class that can choose between possible decisions to respond to an Event.
  The Strategy and Listener classes both respond to an Event by
  optionally returning another Event, which begs the question, why
  not just put strategy logic into Listeners?
  The idea behind separating Listener and Strategy is to keep the two classes simple.
  Listener is responsible for knowing when to mutate the Character's state
  (taking damage, spending resources, etc). The Strategy implements
  complex logic to choose between possible courses of action.
  Mixing the two classes would result in big Listener classes that
  would contain too much complexity. It would be difficult to write
  such a big class, or to test it effectively.
  Isolating decision making logic in the Strategy class also helps
  deal with the fact that different kinds of characters will have
  different strategies around certain aspects of their behavior, and
  it will be easier to write a lot of different little Strategy classes
  than it would be to write several big Listener classes.
