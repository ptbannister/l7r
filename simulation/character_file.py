class CharacterReader(object):
  '''
  Read a Character from a YAML format file.
  Uses a CharacterBuilder to build the character. This will reject invalid characters,
  including characters that don't have enough XP for the indicated build.
  You can always give the character a large number of XP to avoid having to calculate
  the cost of the build!

  Character must have rings and skills.

  Characters may have a school, a profession, or neither.

  Name, xp, advantages, and disadvantages are optional.

  If no name is given, the character is assigned a random UUID for their name.
  If no xp is given, the character is assigned 100 xp.

  Here is an example character file. More examples are available in the data directory
  of this package.
